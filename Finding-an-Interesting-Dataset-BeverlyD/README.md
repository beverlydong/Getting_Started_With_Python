I'm interested in this data because I want to learn more about the different variety of cereals and their nutritional values. I eat cereal fairly frequent but I'm not entirely sure about the amount of sugar or carbs are behind a serving. Many people like me overlook the nutrition labels and don't know how much of something we are consuming all the time.
