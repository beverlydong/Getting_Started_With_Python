I'm interested in this data because I want to learn more about the different variety of cereals and their nutritional values. I eat cereal fairly frequent but I'm not entirely sure about the amount of sugar or carbs are behind a serving. Many people like me overlook the nutrition labels and don't know how much of something we are consuming all the time.

Questions:
1) Which cereals have more than 6 grams of sugar per serving?
2) Which brand out of the two (Kellogs & General Mills) has the most average gram of sugar in the cereals?
3) Is there a relationship between sodium and sugar levels in cereal?
4) Which cereal has the most grams of complex carbohydrates and which one has the least?
5) Which manufacturer has the highest calories?
6) Compare the lowest rated cereal and the highest rated one.
7) What are the top 3 brands' highest rated cereal?
8) Can we predict ratings in relation to sugar?
9) Can display shelf level affect rating? 
10) Is there a correlation between fat and fiber?
